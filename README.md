## Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** The initial dataset, containing over 540,000 records, was loaded into a MySQL database. Data cleaning was performed using SQL to handle null values, remove duplicate transactions, and filter out cancelled orders.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** SQL queries were written to analyze the data from multiple perspectives, including:
    * Monthly sales trends
    * Top 10 products by revenue
    * Top 10 customers by spending
    * Geographical sales distribution
3.  **Dashboard Creation:** The aggregated data from the SQL analysis was exported and connected to Tableau Public to create an interactive dashboard visualizing the key findings.

## Key Findings & Insights

* **Peak Sales Period:** The analysis revealed that November is the month with the highest sales volume, likely due to holiday shopping.
* **Top Products:** The best-selling products were primarily high-volume, low-cost items, suggesting opportunities for product bundling.
* **Geographic Concentration:** The vast majority of revenue (over 85%) originates from the United Kingdom.
* **Customer Value:** A small subset of customers accounts for a significant portion of total revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention strategies.
